Place your profile image here with the filename exactly:

  assets/images/Dlk01(1).jpg

Notes:
- If your system or tools have trouble with parentheses in filenames, consider renaming to `Dlk01-1.jpg` or `profile.jpg` and update the `src` in `index.html` accordingly.
- For best results, use a square image around 400–800px and compressed for web (JPEG/WEBP).
- The HTML in the hero section already references `assets/images/Dlk01(1).jpg` by default.
